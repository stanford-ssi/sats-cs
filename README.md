# SSI Satellites Software
The goal of this project is to an autonmous spacecraft that can navigate in deep-space via asteroid recognition. 

## How to Get Started

### Join SSI
1. Join the SSI slack
2. Join channels #satellites and #satellites-software
3. Send a direct message to @Natalie Cygan with your github username and your email to be added to the repository

### Coding
Clone the git repository (aka download the code). More information is available here: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

Initially, you'll only have read-access and will have to make a private fork of the repo and make pull requests. In general though:

Always work in a branch for whatever feature you're working on, so that you don't accidentally mess something up for other people. To create a branch: git checkout -b some-name. To switch to an existing branch git checkout -some-name

When whichever feature you were working on is complete, merge master into it. First (from within the branch) git pull origin master to merge master into your branch. Fix any conflicts that arise and make sure everything still works. 

### Getting Help
SSI is full of people who want to help you learn and contribute to our projects as much as possible. Current point people for software are Natalie Cygan (@Natalie Cygan) and Katie Mishra (@katie) -- reach out if you have questions!
